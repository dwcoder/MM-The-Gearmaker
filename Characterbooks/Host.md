You are the host, and you will play the character of the inspector. If there are only 8 people, you can be the Luddite (=Luddite=) or the spouse (=Spouse=) while also playing the host.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the evening progresses, and that all the characters get a fair cross-examination.

Make sure the participants understand that they need to establish a means, motive, and opportunity if they want to accuse someone of murder (if they get all the clues, there is just one answer that makes sense).



## During the evening, at start of the event


You should discover the body of Wilbur Haborlian. According to your opinion as an inspector:

 - Wilbur is wearing a very ornate pocket watch. It is stuck at around 04:00. On the back it says "To my dear Husband, for old Times' sake".
 - He was killed with the famous ceremonial knife that belongs to the CEO, and the wound was very *scientific* in nature.
 - Nearby, a can of what looks like petrol lies empty. The body is covered with something that smells of oil. There is a lighter next to the body, and a charred piece of cloth, also covered with the same liquid, and that looks somewhat charred. Nothing else in the room is burnt.
 - A search of the area reveals nothing further of interest, except for a piece of right-wing Luddite propaganda

You all arrived last night, had an early dinner at the property, and you all stayed over. You don't know what everyone was doing after dinner, which ended at about 7pm. 
Nobody from the outside could have done this.


## How to respond to cross examination
You arrived after the murder happened, so it cannot be you. This isn't an opinion, it is a fact.


## Make sure you point out the following during the cross examination (in addition to the things that your own character has to mention

The characters can be cross-examined in any order, but the following is suggested:

 * =Luddite=
 * =PM=
 * =Narco heir=
 * =Narco Sicario=
 * =French savant=
 * =Spouse=
 * =Assistant=
 * =CEO=

You can revisit anyone.
You don't have to be cross-examined yourself, as you arrived after the murder took place.
