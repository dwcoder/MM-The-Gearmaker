You are the host, and you will play the character of the inspector. If there are only 8 people, you can be the Luddite (=Luddite=) or the spouse (=Spouse=) while also playing the host.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the evening progresses, and that all the characters get a fair cross-examination.

Make sure the participants understand that they need to establish a means, motive, and opportunity if they want to accuse someone of murder (if they get all the clues, there is just one answer that makes sense).

During the evening, you should discover the body of Wilbur Haborlian. According to your opinion as an inspector, you believe he was killed about an hour ago, with a knife that appears to belong to the CEO.


## Preparation to be done before the event:

Leave a dagger nearby the body, with the BTD logo on it (wipe it down so there aren't any fingerprints on it).
Prepare a "body" that can be searched. This can be as simple as putting a bunch of pillows on the ground with a sheet over them. Near the body, set up a place that can act as the vitcim's workbench, with some books and tools on it. Leave the Luddite propaganda on this bench.

## How to respond to cross examination
You arrived after the murder happened, so it cannot be you. This isn't an opinion, it is a fact.


## Make sure you point out the following during the cross examination (in addition to the things that your own character has to mention

The characters have to be cross-examined in the following order:

 * =Luddite=
 * =PM=
 * =Narco heir=
 * =Narco Sicario=
 * =French savant=
 * =Spouse=
 * =Assistant=
 * =CEO=

You don't have to be cross-examined yourself, as you arrived after the murder took place.
