## Character background

You are arrogant and you treat these English people with slight contempt; if they could just relax their bureaucracy for a moment they might be able to get something useful done.

You are a decorated French spy, and you have seen active duty. But since you are retired, you now mostly spend your time on diplomacy.
The French have been trying to recruit Wilbur to defect and come over to their side.

## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi: During the time of the murder, you were walking around outside. You were alone, so no one can back this up, unfortunately. No one saw you enter or leave.

If the Prime Minister is hostile towards you, just ignore him. You won't stoop to his level.

Wilbur's wife will point out that you were trying to recruit Wilbur.
She will suggest you killed him as you thought he would reject your offer.

It is true that you tried to recruit him, don't be shy about this. It is also true that you didn't know Wilbur was about to join you. And yes, it would have been within your abilities to kill Wilbur. Heck, you can kill any Englishman! They are so slow, and their excuse for knife fighting is laughable.

But this is where you have to sell your innocence: you had NO motive.

Wilbur was worth more to you alive. Even if he didn't join the French, Wilbur never really picked a side. He believed in open science, and he regularly gave lectures in Europe. He would have published his findings anyway.
If fact, the main reason the French wanted to provide him with funding and shelter is that they wanted his research to flourish! The British bureaucracy was holding Wilbur back. If you wanted to sabotage Wilbur's work, you wouldn't have killed him, you would have just left him in Britain. The Brits and their ridiculous class system did more damage to hinder his progress than a thousand French spies could!

Wilbur was worth more to you alive, and if the English have any sense, they would realise it.
There is really nothing more you can say about this matter. But if the English want to frame you for this crime, there will be hell to pay.
