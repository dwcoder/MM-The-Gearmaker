## Character background

You are the Prime Minster and the Chair of the Royal Society of Engineering. Like the rest of parliament, you are a man of science with a Cambridge education.

You act with dignity and grace, and an upper-class arrogance. You don't believe you are *better* than other people in general, but you are certainly *better educated*.

## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi: You were with =Spouse=, Wilbur's spouse, in the garden at the time of the murder.

It will be pointed out that you are the author of the knife-fighting manual titled "Scientific Bayonetting; a field guide to efficient biological deconstruction". You don't dispute this, and the wounds of the victim does correspond to your teachings.
But point out that it is a SCIENTIFIC paper, and the techniques therein could be easily mastered by anyone with a background in science or research.
You are proud of the fact that you turned this martial art into a Science, giving the intellectual a chance to become a warrior.

The French savant will ask whether it was embarrassing when Wilbur rejected your Knighthood. Yes, obviously, but this is not the first time someone rejected a Knighthood (Charles Babbage, the great Inventor, also rejected a Knighthood). Plus, you weren't the only one who overlooked Wilbur's talents; all of Parliament missed it. Perfectly honest mistake. Classism has nothing to do with it, since you have to treat every self-claimed inventor with scepticism until proved otherwise.

It is true that you were colluding with the CEO to spy on Wilbur. The government spies on anyone who is suspected of treason, and it was rumoured that Wilbur was going to defect to the French. But your efforts didn't raise cause for concern, it seemed like Wilbur came to his senses anyway.

Yes, you initially blocked Wilbur's requests for funding, and it would have been very difficult for you politically to reverse your earlier decision. But you certainly didn't want Wilbur to be dead! 
Politics can be very complicated.
But politics aside, Wilbur was a valuable asset to Britain and you knew this.
Also, why would you murder Wilbur yourself?
