## Character background

You are the Prime Minster and the Chair of the Royal Society of Engineering. Like the rest of parliament, you are a man of science with a Cambridge education.

You act with dignity and grace, and an upper-class arrogance. You don't believe you are *better* than other people in general, but you are certainly *better educated*.

## How to respond to cross examination

You don't have an alibi. You went to bed early because you weren't feeling very well.

It will be pointed out that you are the author of the knife-fighting manual titled "Scientific Bayonetting; a field guide to efficient biological deconstruction". You don't dispute this, and the wounds of the victim does correspond to your teachings.
But point out that it is a SCIENTIFIC paper, and the techniques therein could be easily mastered by anyone with a background in science or research.
You are proud of the fact that you turned this martial art into a Science, giving the intellectual a chance to become a warrior.

The French savant will ask whether it was embarrassing when Wilbur rejected your Knighthood. Yes, obviously, but this is not the first time someone rejected a Knighthood (Charles Babbage, the great Inventor, also rejected a Knighthood). Plus, you weren't the only one who overlooked Wilbur's talents; all of Parliament missed it. Perfectly honest mistake. Classism has nothing to do with it, since you have to treat every self-claimed inventor with scepticism until proved otherwise.

It is true that you were colluding with the CEO to spy on Wilbur. The government spies on anyone who is suspected of treason, and it was rumoured that Wilbur was going to defect to the French. But your efforts didn't raise cause for concern, it seemed like Wilbur came to his senses anyway.

It is also true that your Premiership has been suffering a bit lately, as will be pointed out by =Spouse=. You won't survive another political scandal. But then, you've had a good run.

Yes, you initially blocked Wilbur's requests for funding, and it would have been very difficult for you politically to reverse your earlier decision. But you certainly didn't want Wilbur to be dead! 
Politics can be very complicated.
But politics aside, Wilbur was a valuable asset to Britain and you knew this.
Also, why would you murder Wilbur yourself?? Surely you'd get henchmen for that.

Reveal this last, and only if it looks like you have no other options (not during the first questioning):
You could not have killed Wilbur.
You have been suffering from terrible arthritis. You can hardly hold a pen! Not to mention a knife.
You have been keeping this a secret, as you don't want to appear weak at this politically sensitive point in time.
=CEO= will back this up, he is one of your few confidantes.
You suspect no one else knew about this, you kept it a state secret.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters

The scoundrel! Will the French stop at nothing? Surely it was them who killed Wilbur. They must have thought, if they can't have him, no one can!
Act very hostile towards the French savant, and heckle =him French savant= if =he French savant= says negative things about Britain.

### =Spouse=

### =Assistant=
Ask whether =she Assistant= knew about the plans of the French to recruit Wilbur.
