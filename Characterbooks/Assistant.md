## Character background

You were orphaned as a child by a drug turf war; one of the many that was fought by the Ryan family during their "trying times". Thereafter you were raised in a Luddite orphanage, where they taught you the classics. You have abandoned most of their anti-progress doctrines, but you are still a nationalist. You still read some of their propaganda, but is a secret you should not share, as it can put you in an awkward spot.

You don't mind sharing how much you love your country though.

You became Wilbur's hand-chosen assistant a few years ago.
People speculated that the two of your were sleeping together, but this is not true. The notion is actually insulting, you received the role wholly on merit. He had many affairs inside and outside of his work life, but you were not one of those.

The Prime Minister made it very hard for Wilbur to get government funding, and therefore he had to resort to taking money from the Ryan family; which you always felt uncomfortable with. But this was the only way; it was something you had to stomach: anything for the betterment of England.

But when Wilbur told you tonight after 9pm that he was going to go to France to join the savants, and that he would take you with, that was something you could not stomach. After all you went through, you find out he is a traitor. France cannot have Wilbur, you will have to continue his work yourself. So you killed Wilbur with a knife, using the techniques you read about in the Prime Minister's knife-fighting guide for scientists.
You then used the oil, which you knew wouldn't burn, to make it look like someone tried to burn the body to get rid of the evidence. You are specifically trying to frame the Prime Minister, who went to bed early after dinner and probably doesn't have an alibi.

Luckily there are many other suspects present tonight. Your goal is to get through the evening without getting found out.

## How to respond to cross examination

Information to reveal asap:
You can confirm that the smell and the weird liquid on the body is from a lubricant that Wilbur used to oil his gears. 
The lubricant is a specialist type, and it is not flammable. However, it looks and smells flammable, and it's kept in cans that look like petrol cans.
You only recently started using this.

You don't have an alibi. But when asked about it, you will say that you were in the bathroom. Obviously, you were there alone. (Sarcastically) Does anyone else take an attach√© to the bathroom?

When asked whether you were sleeping with Wilbur, you can truthfully deny it. You got your job through merit, not through sexual favours. You are aware of all his affairs, but you were not one of them.
You had a good, sometimes strained, but always professional relationship with =Spouse=.

When asked whether you studied the Prime Minister's knife-fighting manual, lie and say no.

If someone asks you about the right-wing pamphlet they found with Luddite materials on it, pretend you don't know about it. If the Luddite accuses you of being a two-face, tell =him Luddite= that you are forever grateful for the education they gave you; that you still share their passion, not their disdain for all things mechanical.

When =Luddite= accuses you of abandoning them, tell =him Luddite= that the machines are what is best for England, it is the only way to ascertain our prosperity as a nation. You know =he Luddite= will not see it this way, but it is the hard truth that we must all accept.
You respect how much he cares for the country --- we all should --- you just think he is misguided.

The Prime Minster will ask whether you knew of the plans of the French. Yes, Wilbur told you that he was considering it, and that he was having a tough time with the decision.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)

### The Victim

### =Luddite=
You can back up the claim that =Luddite= was never alone in a room with Wilbur, =he Luddite= hated Wilbur so much that he _aggressively_ avoided him.

### =PM=
Accuse the Prime Minister of colluding with =CEO= to spy on Wilbur. Say you saw their private-sector agents following you, listening in on conversations, and going through your trash.

Also accuse the Prime Minister of making it hard for Wilbur to get funding. If it wasn't for =his PM= jealousy, Wilbur would have never had to resort to taking money from the Ryans, nor would he have had to entertain the traitorous notions of the French.

### =Narco heir=
You hate =Narco heir=. Tell everyone that you were orphaned by the drug war, and people like =Narco heir= benefited directly from the violence. 

=Narco heir= will respond that they funded Wilbur. You should mention that, while they funded him initially, Wilbur had recently try to cut all ties to them and their blood money. This made them angry, and you think this is why they had Wilbur killed. After all, this is how they deal with their enemies: by killing them.

### =Narco Sicario=
You are sure =Narco Sicario= has blood on =his Narco Sicario= hands, make a comment along this lines. Also mention that it wouldn't be unusual for =Narco Sicario= to "take care" of someone who disrespected the Ryan family, like in the *good old days* (say this last bit with contempt).
=He Narco Sicario= will also know how to handle a knife.

### =French savant=

### =Spouse=

### =Assistant=

### =CEO=

### =Inspector=
