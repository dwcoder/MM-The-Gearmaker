title: =Assistant=

## Character background

You were orphaned as a child by a drug turf war; one of the many that was fought by the Ryan family during their "trying times". Thereafter you were raised in a Luddite orphanage, where they taught you the classics. You have abandoned most of their anti-progress doctrines, but you are still a nationalist. You don't mind sharing how much you love your country.

You became Wilbur's hand-chosen assistant a few years ago.
People speculated that the two of your were sleeping together, but this is not true. The notion is actually insulting, you received the role wholly on merit. He had many affairs inside and outside of his work life, but you were not one of those.

The Prime Minister made it very hard for Wilbur to get government funding, and therefore he had to resort to taking money from the Ryan family; which you always felt uncomfortable with. But this was the only way; it was something you had to stomach: anything for the betterment of England.



## How to respond to cross examination

Information to reveal asap:
You can confirm that the smell and the weird liquid on the body is from a lubricant that Wilbur used to oil his gears. 
The lubricant is a specialist type, and it is not flammable. However, it looks and smells flammable, and it's kept in cans that look like petrol cans.
You only recently started using this.

You don't have an alibi. You were in your room during the time of the murder, you went there straight after dinner.

When asked whether you were sleeping with Wilbur, you can truthfully deny it. You got your job through merit, not through sexual favours. You are aware of all his affairs, but you were not one of them.
You had a good, sometimes strained, but always professional relationship with =Spouse=.

When asked whether you studied the Prime Minister's knife-fighting manual, respond that you were aware of it, but never studied it.

If the Luddite accuses you of being a two-face, tell =him Luddite= that you are forever grateful for the education they gave you; that you still share their passion for England to prosper, just not their disdain for all things mechanical.

When =Luddite= accuses you of abandoning them, tell =him Luddite= that the machines are what is best for England, it is the only way to ascertain our prosperity as a nation. You know =he Luddite= will not see it this way, but it is the hard truth that we must all accept.
You respect how much he cares for the country --- we all should --- you just think he is misguided.

The Prime Minster will ask whether you knew of the plans of the French. Yes, Wilbur told you that he was considering it, and that he was having a tough time with the decision.
Obviously, you told him not to go.
We must all do what is best for England.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)

### The Victim

### =Luddite=
You can back up the claim that =Luddite= was never alone in a room with Wilbur, =he Luddite= hated Wilbur so much that he _aggressively_ avoided him.

### =PM=

Accuse the Prime Minister of colluding with =CEO= to spy on Wilbur. Say you saw their private-sector agents following you, listening in on conversations, and going through your trash.

Also accuse the Prime Minister of making it hard for Wilbur to get funding. If it wasn't for =his PM= jealousy, Wilbur would have never had to resort to taking money from the Ryans, nor would he have had to entertain the traitorous notions of the French.

In your opinion, the Prime minister had the most to gain from Wilbur's death, given his long running feud and the political sensitivity of it all.

### =Narco heir=
You hate =Narco heir=. Tell everyone that you were orphaned by the drug war, and people like =Narco heir= benefited directly from the violence. 

=Narco heir= will respond that they funded Wilbur. You should mention that, while they funded him initially, Wilbur had recently try to cut all ties to them and their blood money. This made them angry, and you think this is why they had Wilbur killed. After all, this is how they deal with their enemies: by killing them.

### =Narco Sicario=

You are sure =Narco Sicario= has blood on =his Narco Sicario= hands, make a comment along this lines. Also mention that it wouldn't be unusual for =Narco Sicario= to "take care" of someone who disrespected the Ryan family, like in the *good old days* (say this last bit with contempt).
=He Narco Sicario= will also know how to handle a knife.

### =French savant=

You have no questions for =French savant=, the French Savant.
Ask everyone why the French Savant has to be here! It makes no sense.
England can stand on its own.
You should not be discussing things with a French person present, not even to mention one who was an ex-Spy!

### =Spouse=

### =Assistant=

### =CEO=

### =Inspector=
