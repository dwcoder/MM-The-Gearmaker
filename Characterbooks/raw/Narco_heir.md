title: =Narco heir=
...

## Character background

You are the heir of a family that owns a multinational corporation, which itself owns many other companies.
Your family fortune was amassed via illicit means; your father was the largest opium smuggler in Europe. 
He was a very smart man, however, and he covered  his tracks expertly. Thus, no illegality has ever been proven and in the last 40 years the family worked hard to make all their holdings legal.

Plus, your family is focussing on a growing, new business sector: warfare.

You act with dignity and grace, and you will not stand for anyone suggesting your family is embroiled in illegal activities.

## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi: You were with =Narco Sicario= in the kitchen. No one else saw you.

=Assistant= will accuse your family of killing her father. Respond that you cannot speak for your family who are diseased, but that anyone is welcome to take allegations to court and prove their case.
Mention that you have only ever used your fortune to do good: it was YOU who funded Wilbur when no one else believed in him. 

People might suggest that you wanted to kill Wilbur since he wanted to distance himself from your family. That was certainly his right. If anyone accuses your family of using violence to punish disrespect, tell them all that is long since behind you. Those were different times.

## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)


### The Victim

### =Luddite=

### =PM=

### =Narco heir=

### =Narco Sicario=
You can confirm that you were with =Narco Sicario= in the kitchen at the time of the murder.

### =French savant=

### =Spouse=
Ask =Spouse= whether =she Spouse= really expects people to believe that Wilbur's affairs didn't bother =her Spouse=

### =Assistant=

### =CEO=
The company of =CEO= is owned in part by the Ryan family, so you are vaguely aware of how it operates.
You know that they tried to hire Wilbur on multiple occasions, but that he always refused.
Wilbur believed in research for the public good, and insisted that all his research be published open source and available to all.
Surely if his most recent work were to be published, it would result in a massive cost to the company; some of their own expensive research might become obsolete?

Moreover, if he left and join the French, could they not start a company to rival BTD?

### =Inspector=
