title: =CEO=

## Character background

You are the CEO of British Transcontinental Defence (BTD).
Your company specialises in copper communications cables, and defence communication technology.
Your company has also expanded in recent years to provide encryption and espionage services.

You have always wanted to hire Wilbur to come and work for your company, but he insisted on remaining an academic, working towards the public good.

## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi is that you were sitting in the bedroom, reading. No one can corroborate this.

Yes, Wilbur was killed with your knife. But you can point out that you know nothing about knife fighting (this is your biggest defence; you didn't have the means to kill him yourself). You weren't a scientist and you have never read the Prime Minister's knife-fighting manual. The weapon is ceremonial, and you didn't even know it was sharp enough to hurt someone. You've always used it as an expensive letter opener. Whoever killed Wilbur must have really known their stuff.
You left the knife in your coat, on the coat rack.
Anyone could have gotten it, and it was quite well known that you carried this ceremonial knife with you at all times (as does every CEO of BTD).

You tried to recruit Wilbur, and it is a shame that he never joined.
He always insisted on publishing all his works open-source.
While you would have preferred to have his inventions all for yourself, it is not that simple. 
You could still use his inventions; your company was in the best position to monetize his inventions.
His work might make some of the patents held by your company obsolete, but that is the nature of the business!
One cannot have progress without obsolescence. You and your shareholders knew this very well.

And frankly, you didn't care whether Wilbur joined the French or not.
As everyone knows, Wilbur was a-political.
Since your company dealt with both sides, you'd profit now matter where he went.
Even if the French started a new company, they'd have similar troubles recruiting Wilbur away from academia.
You weren't spying on Wilbur because you were worried about him, you were doing it as a service to the government. 
A service they were paying for; espionage is good business.

Reveal only if =PM= (the PM) asks you to:
You are aware of the PM's bad arthritis. He would probably not have been able to hold the knife.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)


### The Victim

### =Luddite=

### =PM=
You corroborated with the CEO to spy on Wilbur.
You found out that the French had contacted Wilbur and were offering him a research position, with practically unlimited funding.
The Prime minister wasn't happy about this, and due to =his PM= earlier decision to block many of Wilbur's requests for funding, =he PM= was in an awkward position. =He PM= would either have to admit that =he PM= was wrong to reject Wilbur's initial requests, or keep on blocking him. Both of these would be politically unpopular. Perhaps it would all be better if Wilbur went away?

Wilbur was completely a-political. Powerful, influential people who don't care for politics are oft a thorn in the side for politicians, who need them to care.


### =Narco heir=

### =Narco Sicario=

### =French savant=

### =Spouse=

You don't want to attack a woman just widowed, but you need to point out that =Spouse= was a scientist, and therefore she would have been able to study the Prime Minster's knife-fighting techniques with ease.

Moreover, during your (totally legal) conspiracy with the Prime Minister to spy on Wilbur, you found proof of multiple affairs. Perhaps hell hath no fury like a woman scorned?
