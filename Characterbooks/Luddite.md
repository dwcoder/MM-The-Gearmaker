title: =Luddite=
...

## Character background
(This provides you with some background on how to act, but you don't have to reveal all of this unless prompted.)

As a prominent member of the Luddites, you are very sceptical about all things mechanical (this is the 1890s, the term technology doesn't exist yet) and the big changes it had on society.

The Luddites are very conservative; they want to conserve the "British" way of life and the implicit structures thereof. Some factions of the Luddites are becoming extremist in their beliefs and what they sometimes verges on the edge of terrorism. You cannot condone this, but you also do not condemn it. People pushed to extreme measures will do extreme things. Your propaganda and writing cannot be to blame, if people are afraid of your ideas, the problem lies with them.

You are of the House of Lords, but that organisations is merely a shadow of its former self and doesn't really have any sway any more. Despite this, the Luddites still control  quite a bit of Old Money and thus are still influential as such.


## How to respond to cross examination

You didn't kill Wilbur, but good riddance, it is a good thing he is dead. Be very open about your disdain for him and his new-fangled, liberal, Marxist, commie machines. It was putting a lot of good Britons out of a job.

In fact, you hated Wilbur so much that you ensured to never be in a room with him. Whenever he would enter the room, you would leave it, and the prime minister and Wilbur's assistant can attest to this --- ask them. During the time of the murder, you were alone, in the study (no one can corroborate this).

You can also point out that you are an old, scholarly man who doesn't know the first thing about weapons handling. You always firmly believed that the pen is mightier than the sword, and thus you used your pen, through propaganda, to reprimand Wilbur and his blasphemous science.

If =Spouse= argues that hateful words lead to violence, warn them that this is a common accusation, and that they'd better have evidence that will hold up in court, lest they want to be sued for libel.
