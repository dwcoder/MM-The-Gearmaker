title: =Narco Sicario=
...
## Character background

You were the right hand man of the Ryan family patriarch, George Alexander Ryan.
During the family's drug trafficking days, you oversaw his security.
While you are aware of murders happening in their turf wars, you never got your own hands dirty that way.




## How to respond to cross examination
Your alibi: You where in the kitchen at the time of the murder with =Narco heir=.

=Assistant= is very hostile towards the Ryan family, and =she Assistant= will make an accusation that you killed Wilbur.
You can admit that things weren't always above board with the Ryan family business, but you only took care of security. You certainly never used violence, luckily you didn't have to.
Plus, in the last 20 years you helped them diversify their holdings away from all the "excitement".


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)


### The Victim

### =Luddite=

### =PM=
Point out that =PM= is the author and inventor of the Scientific knife fighting system. Tell =him PM= you have seen the result of that system in your line of work, and that the wounds of the victim are exactly the same.

### =Narco heir=
You can confirm that you were with =Narco heir= in the kitchen at the time of the murder.

### =Narco Sicario=

### =French savant=
When people accuse =French savant= of the crime, you can point out that =he French savant= would certainly know how to use a knife; it is standard spy training. You know this from the circles you operate in.

### =Spouse=
As the person responsible for the security matters of the Ryan family, it was your duty to look into Wilbur. 
You discovered no security threat to Ms. Rae, but you did notice Wilbur had a large number of affairs.
Was =Spouse= aware of this?

You don't want to attack a woman just widowed, but you need to point out that =Spouse= was a scientist, and therefore she would have been able to study the Prime Minster's knife-fighting techniques with ease.

### =Assistant=

Point out that the assistant, as a scientist, could also have learned the knife-fighting techniques. You have to work hard to point out all those who had the abilities to kill with a knife, lest they think you were the only one capable of such manoeuvres.

### =CEO=

### =Inspector=
