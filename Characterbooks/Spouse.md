# Name: =Spouse=
## Character background

You were educated at Cambridge and once had a promising career as an engine-maker yourself (you built a chess-playing machine at the age of 14).
You left all of that behind to be with Wilbur.
One of you had to make a career sacrifice, and his was showing more promise at the time. 

You are aware that Wilbur had many affairs, but you still loved him deeply. You believed that your connection was deeper than just physical, but you had always hoped that he would stop his wandering.
You never had affairs of your own.


## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi: You were with the Prime Minister at the time, in the garden.

People will ask whether you knew about Wilbur's affairs. Yes, you were well aware, and details of Wilbur's indiscretions and thus the nature of your relationship has been well reported on by the yellow press.
You can assure people that despite all this, you still loved Wilbur.
You had a deeper relationship with him than most people will understand.

People might not believe this, so you will have to re-assure them.
While the affairs certainly didn't make you happy, you wouldn't have killed him over something so trivial.
Consider this: everyone wanted a part of Wilbur, he was a very in-demand man.
Yet he would always return to you, after everyone else had their piece of him, his heart belonged to YOU.
No one else in the world can say that.

And besides, if you really wanted him dead, you would have done this a long time ago, not at some public event like tonight.

If you are accused of studying the Prime Minister's knife-fighting manual, deny it. You had no need for it.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)


### The Victim

### =Luddite=
You are very angry at =Luddite=, =he Luddite= always wrote hateful words about Wilbur, and =his Luddite= propaganda is responsible for the disdain people felt towards Wilbur; they sometimes threw rocks at him in the street.
You are sure =he Luddite= killed Wilbur, either directly or indirectly.

### =PM=
You can confirm that you were with =PM=, the Prime Minister, at the time of the murder. You were having pleasant discussions in the Garden, but there wasn't anyone else who saw you.

### =Narco heir=

### =Narco Sicario=

### =French savant=
You should tell everyone that the Savant was trying to recruit Wilbur to join them in France. 
Wilbur discussed this with you extensively.

Although Wilbur acted like he would reject the offer, he actually made up his mind yesterday. You don't think he has told anyone else. Perhaps the Savant was sent to kill Britian's greatest asset, not knowing that he was about to join the French!

### =Spouse=

### =Assistant=

Ask the assistant whether she was sleeping with your husband.

### =CEO=

### =Inspector=
