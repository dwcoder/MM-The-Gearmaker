title: =Spouse=

## Character background

You were educated at Cambridge and once had a promising career as an engine-maker yourself (you built a chess-playing machine at the age of 14).
You left all of that behind to be with Wilbur.
One of you had to make a career sacrifice, and his was showing more promise at the time. 

You are aware that Wilbur had many affairs, but you still loved him deeply. You believed that your connection was deeper than just physical, but you had always hoped that he would stop his wandering.
You never had affairs of your own.


## How to respond to cross examination

Your alibi: Between 9pm and 10pm, you were walking around outside. You briefly ran into =French savant= and you shared some friendly words. =He French savant= looked fine; not like someone who just committed a murder. But you can't really judge these things 

Information to offer freely:
Wilbur told you last night, after dinner, that he had finally decided, during dinner, he was going to take up the French on their offer. This was around 9pm. You don't know if he told anyone else. He then went to his workshop, and you went for a walk outside to contemplate how nice it would be to live in France, away from all the rumours and British tabloids.

You gave him the pocket watch as a gift. It's your favourite brand, a weird English one, not Swiss. It is more accurate than the Swiss, but it only has a power reserve of 30 hours from a full wind (Swiss ones have a 60hour power reserve).
If you want it to be as accurate as possible, you need to wind it every day at the same time. Wilbur gave his a full wound every night at 10pm exactly, as he was a punctual man.

People will ask whether you knew about Wilbur's affairs. Yes, you were well aware, and details of Wilbur's indiscretions and thus the nature of your relationship has been well reported on by the yellow press.
You can assure people that despite all this, you still loved Wilbur.
You had a deeper relationship with him than most people will understand.

People might not believe this, so you will have to re-assure them.
While the affairs certainly didn't make you happy, you wouldn't have killed him over something so trivial.
Consider this: everyone wanted a part of Wilbur, he was a very in-demand man.
Yet he would always return to you, after everyone else had their piece of him, his heart belonged to YOU.
No one else in the world can say that.

And besides, if you really wanted him dead, you would have done this a long time ago, not at some public event like tonight.

If you are accused of studying the Prime Minister's knife-fighting manual, deny it. You had no need for it.


## Notes for cross examination of other characters
(This contains questions to ask other characters while they are being cross examined.)


### The Victim

### =Luddite=
You are very angry at =Luddite=, =he Luddite= always wrote hateful words about Wilbur, and =his Luddite= propaganda is responsible for the disdain people felt towards Wilbur; they sometimes threw rocks at him in the street.
It was unfair for =Luddite=, who is a deeply political and right wing figure, to have attacked Wilbur so much.
Wilbur was well-known to be a-political. He only cared about science, and art of gear making.


You are sure =he Luddite= killed Wilbur, either directly or indirectly.

### =PM=

Make it clear that you think the Prime Minister, =PM=, has the biggest motive.

The PM is down in the polls, and is losing power over =his PM= own party. Given the giant embarrassment he suffered when the Royal Society originally overlooked Wilbur, at =his PM= own recommendation, he could not have expected to survive another scandal: Losing Wilbur to the French!

The PM is a very classist =man PM=. Killing Wilbur to save =his PM= own skin would just be one more dead commoner!
=He PM= certainly had the most to lose.


### =Narco heir=

### =Narco Sicario=

### =French savant=

You can confirm that you saw =French savant= in the garden. You were having pleasant discussions in the Garden, but there wasn't anyone else who saw you.

You should tell everyone that the Savant was trying to recruit Wilbur to join them in France. 
Wilbur discussed this with you extensively.

Although Wilbur acted like he would reject the offer, he actually made up his mind yesterday. You don't think he has told anyone else. Perhaps the Savant was sent to kill Britian's greatest asset, not knowing that he was about to join the French!

### =Spouse=

### =Assistant=

You had a good, albeit professional relationship with =Assistant=. You do want to know whether =she Assistant= actually never slept with your husband.

### =CEO=

### =Inspector=
