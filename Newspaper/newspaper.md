# Special review issue

Since Charles Babbage completed his difference engine in 1844, which was shortly followed by his analytical engine, the civilised world rapidly underwent a mechanical revolution. Relieving the English Gentleman of the tedious calculations which accompany industrial endeavours, man has been given the freedom to expend intellectual capacity on more lofty endeavours.
Through this, Britain has not only flourished herself, but also shared her great strides with all of the Empire.
In this issue we continue the review of the recent industrial consequences of our great calculating engines.

Every industry has been affected for the better by our knowledge machinery, and while our readers will be most familiar with the military applications of thinking engines --- especially that of cryptography --- we would like to focus attention on the professions of machine making and craftsmen.
The demand for computing machines has lead to an exponential increase in the demand for fine-precision gears and components. Nowhere are gears better manufactured than in Britain, and our nation will soon have the ability to mass produce near-identical copies of the series GBG gearsets. It has been said that the Empire is built on cotton, this newspaper posits that it is kept running by precision gears.

# Historic meeting coming to London
Doom prophets, naysayers, and Luddites would have us believe that our economy will lead to world-wide war on an industrial scale, but the English Gentleman continues to enjoy great quality of life. This newspaper has learned that there will be an unofficial meeting between the cardinal minds behind our economy on 11 April, 19h00 at the Tower of London. The meeting will no doubt further build Anglo-Franco relationships and set a course for the next industrial leap. Below we have compiled biographies of all the members who will be present for this two-day affair.

**Wilbur Haborlian** \
The man whose influence on the industrial age has been second only to that of the great engine-maker, Charles Babbage. Being the nation's finest gear maker, Wilbur has not only near-perfected the precision and tolerance, but he is said to be working on a mass-production system that will churn out gears by the thousands.
The holder of 80 patents, Wilbur hails from humble beginnings and little is known of his upbringing in various foster families. Initially rejected by the Royal Society due to lack of educational pedigree, his techniques and successes speak for themselves.
Thanks to discovery and patronage from the Ryan family, Wilbur was able to achieve great things.
Despite all the yellow-press rumours of adulterous nature, Wilbur has been married all his life to his wife, lady =Spouse=.

**=Luddite=** \
Self-described old-money =gentleman Luddite=, =Luddite= is mostly known as a member of the now-defunct House of Lords. Not one to shy away from public life, =he Luddite= acts as the unofficial leader of the Luddites, who continue to preach their anti-engineering, moral and religious message.
While mostly regarded as harmless, the Luddites still control substantial wealth as a group, and their nationalistic propaganda is thought by many to be populist pandering; the Luddites have seen their wealth multiplied many times by our Industrial Revolution.
Hence, they are still consulted on important matters of economy and state, and =Luddite= is sure to be seen at any meetings of importance.


**=PM=** \
=His PM= excellency the Prime Minister and Chair of the Royal Society of Engineering.
Cambridge educated, =PM= successfully lead Britain through the transition to constitutional technocracy. While still derided for =his PM= inability to identify and develop Wilbur Haborlian, one must admit the Prime Minister has had far more successes than failures in =his PM= tenure.
Inventor of the fighting system used by the British Armed forces, published in =his PM= text "Scientific Bayonetting, a Field Guide to Biological Deconstruction".


**=Narco heir=** \
The =heir Narco heir= to the mighty Ryan fortune; a multinational umbrella corporation that owns companies in nearly every field. It has been speculated that the deceased Ryan patriarch, George Alexander Ryan, amassed his fortune by being the biggest Opium smuggler in Europe, but this has never been proven.
The family have expanded to more lucrative industries in recent years, like industrial warfare equipment.

**=Narco Sicario=** \
=Narco Sicario= acted as right hand =man Narco Sicario= and chief security adviser to the Ryan family, and has been with them for 25 years. Being near the Ryan family necessitates mystery and rumour, and the yellow press speculates that =Narco Sicario= used to be the Ryan hitman. Far be it from this newspaper to repeat such allegations, and we merely note that anywhere =Narco heir= appears in public, =name only Narco Sicario= is bound to be there.


**=French savant=** \
Representing the newly-independent France, =French savant= is a retired french spy and intelligence official, who has seen =his French savant= fair share of active duty in some of the recent European skirmishes.
Now interested only in diplomacy, =he French savant= has brokered many deals between the French and other European interests; ensuring that France has a seat at the European table.

**=Spouse=** \
Willbur's Cambridge educated wife. She built a chess-playing engine when she was only fourteen years old.
She abandoned a promising career in the engine-making arts to live in Wilbur's shadow, as British customs only allow for one genius per household.
She has stayed with her husband and supported him through the years of poverty, as well as the succeeding years filled with scandalous rumours.

**=Assistant=** \
Assistant and protégée to Wilbur, this prodigy arose from humble beginnings to secure multiple scholarships and finally ended up as permanent researcher on many of Wilbur's projects, where she has been diligently documenting and publishing his work as quick as he could produce it.
Said to have been orphaned during the drug turf-wars of the London slums, she received shelter in a Luddite-funded orphanage in North London where she developed a liking in the engineering arts, despite their protests and her training in the classics.

**=CEO=**  \
Chief Executive Officer of British Trans-continental Defence (BTD) Ltd.
The company is partly owned by the Ryan family and specialises in copper communications cables and defence communications technology. =CEO= has grown the company eight-fold during =his CEO= tenure, but they have been accused of selling to both sides of the Anglo-Franco aggression. Whoever loses in a hypothetical war between these two industrial superpowers, BTD Ltd. is sure to have a winning balance sheet.

**=Inspector=**  \
Negotiations consultant and mediator, used to work for Scotland Yard.
A self-proclaimed pacifist; =he Inspector= is widely respected and regular attendee at any events where national and international matters are discussed and negotiated, and is said by many to be the sole proprietor of peace during recent times where nations have often been at each other's throats.

# Letters to the editor

Dear Sir

*This newspaper is quick to point out the benefits of the Godless march towards Mechanisation, but it ignores the good British people who are either being replaced by machines, or the scourge filtering through our borders on the beastly, newfangled steel passenger ships with their trailing black plume. Very soon the British way of life will be destroyed and nothing will remain but bastardised remnants of the classes that once formed the bastion of our great Empire.*

Yours, Luddite for Life

Dear Sir

*In response to the article extolling the virtues of our Mechanically advanced society --- which received criticisms from our Luddite brethren as usual --- I would like to state my support for your thesis that Britons are better off. Take, for example, the recent advances in the manufacturing of soap. Thanks to advanced detergents, the average British household is spending considerably less time scrubbing their pots, their pans, and their pantaloons. This fact is quickly lost on the Luddites, whose classes had these duties performed by servants.*

Yours faithfully, John Q. Public.
