## Instructions

This is a murder mystery written for 8-9 characters.
There are 8 main characters, and a ninth "extra" character who is not required for the story.
The extra character is that of the inspector, who should preferably be played by the host.
This character is not part of the main story, but he/she can still partake in the mystery and try to solve it.

If there are only 8 people, the host can play the character of
the Luddite (=Luddite=) or the spouse (=Spouse=) while also playing the host.
If you are the host, do not read any of the character books as it might reveal the mystery, robbing you of the opportunity to solve it yourself.

## Rules and format of the game
The are also explained in each of the character booklets, as well as in the character booklet titled "Host.pdf" which you, as the host, should read immediately after this document.
In summary, this murder mystery shouldn't be played during the course of a dinner like other mysteries.
Rather, the dialogue should to be acted out before dinner, and then the characters should try to piece together the solution during a meal.

This murder mystery is meant to have a single, attainable solution.
Like logic puzzle, once you have all the clues correctly lined up there should only be one possible answer.
This depends on collecting all the clues and interpreting them correctly.
At the very least, a suspect should have *means*, *motive*, and *opportunity*.
Alibis and co-conspirators might complicate matters.
