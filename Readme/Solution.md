title: Solution
...

Since the watch has a 30 hours power reserve and was stuck at 04:00am, it means it wasn't wound last night. The last time it was wound was 10pm the nigh before Wilbur's death. He was thus killed before he could wind it (at 10:00) and after he was last spotted by his wife (9pm).

We thus also know it wasn't =Spouse= who killed him, since =she Spouse= would probably have remembered to wind his watch.

It was =Assistant=, the assistant.

Wilbur went to his study at just after 9pm and found his assistant there. He told =her Assistant= that he was going to go to France to join the savants.
There were hints throughout the evening that =Assistant= is a strong nationalist.
Thus, Wilbur leaving to join the French was something =she Assistant= could not stomach. He is a traitor. France cannot have Wilbur, =she Assistant=  will have to continue his work alone.
So =she Assistant= killed Wilbur with a knife, using the techniques in the Prime Minister's knife-fighting guide for scientists (which can be studied and mastered by any scientist).
=She Assistant= then used the oil, which =she Assistant= knew wouldn't burn, to make it look like someone tried to burn the body to get rid of the evidence. 
=She Assistant= specifically tried to frame the Prime Minister, who went to bed early after dinner and probably didn't have an alibi.

Basically =she Assistant= left clues there to implicate plenty of other characters:

  * The propaganda, which would implicate the Luddite, =Luddite=
  * She used the knife belonging to the CEO, =CEO=
  * She used the knife-fighting techniques developed by the PM, =PM=

=Her Assistant= motive:

=She Assistant= didn't want Wilbur joining the French. =She Assistant= is still a nationalist, albeit not a Luddite. =She Assistant= is still sympathetic to their cause.

Wilbur told =her Assistant= just after 9pm that he was going to go to the French, and that he had made up his mind.
After being abandoned so many times in =her Assistant= life, this was one last ultimate betrayal: =her Assistant= mentor leaving to join the French!
Can't have that.

The Assistant also doesn't have an alibi (and thus had opportunity)

The Assistant has means: =she Assistant= is a scientist and therefore could have studied the scientific knife-fighting manual.


So =Assistant= tried to frame the Prime Minister, =PM=. =He PM= is the perfect patsy: 

  * =He PM= doesn't have an alibi
  * =He PM= would have known how to do it
  * =He PM= had a strong motive.
  * =He PM= would not have known about the lubrication that's not flammable, so it looked like =he PM= was trying to burn the body.
  
However, =Assistant= didn't know that =PM=, the Prime Minister, had bad arthritis.
