title: Solution
...

Since the watch has a 30 hours power reserve and was stuck at 04:00am, it means it wasn't wound last night. The last time it was wound was 10pm the nigh before Wilbur's death. He was thus killed before he could wind it (at 10:00) and after he was last spotted by his wife (9pm).

The assistant had motive.
=She Assistant= didn't want Wilbur joining the French. =She Assistant= is still a nationalist, albeit not a Luddite. =She Assistant= is still sympathetic to their cause (hence the propaganda).
Wilbur told =her Assistant= just after 9pm that he was going to go to the French, and that he had made up his mind.
After being abandoned so many times in =her Assistant= life, this was one last ultimate betrayal: =her Assistant= mentor leaving to join the enemy!
Can't have that.

The Assistant also doesn't have an alibi.

The Assistant has means: =she Assistant= is a scientist and therefore could have studied the scientific bayonetting manual.

So =Assistant= tried to frame the Prime Minister, =PM=. =He PM= is the perfect patsy: 

  * =He PM= doesn't have an alibi
  * =He PM= would have known how to do it
  * =He PM= had a strong motive.
  * =He PM= would not have known about the lubrication that's not flammable, so it looked like =he PM= was trying to burn the body.
  
However, =Assistant= didn't know that =PM=, the Prime Minister, had bad arthritis.
