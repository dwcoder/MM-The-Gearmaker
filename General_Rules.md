# Rules

**You are welcome to keep these notes with you and consult them as needed. You don't have to learn the information by heart, but some preparation will make the evening more enjoyable. At the very least, read through the information once before arrival.**

Arrive in character, and try to stay in character for the remainder of the evening.
Below are your speaking notes and clues.
These include information about your character, as well as your relationship with other characters.
During the night, a murder will take place, after which each of the characters will be informally cross examined, taking turns.

After the cross examinations, all the guests will sit down for a dinner during which they will try to figure out who the murderer is.

There is no set script, but during the cross examination some of the other characters will accuse you of things, or ask you questions. Characters are free to revisit questions and clarify statements after a cross examination.
Act as you would if you are locked in a room with a killer; with respect, but suspicion.

You should give them the answers below, and you should respond accordingly.
You are not allowed to lie about any of the information below, and you _have_ to reveal the relevant information if prompted. You don't have to reveal information if you feel that you haven't been asked the relevant question.

If you are asked something completely irrelevant, you are free to improvise an answer, as long as it doesn't create new relationships and intrigue (outside of that provided below) between characters and thus confuse the story. If you don't want to improvise an answer to an irrelevant question, respond with **"I don't see how that is relevant"**.

After your speaking notes, there will follow a list of the characters, in the order they will be interrogated.
Under some character appears specific questions you should ask them.
Make sure you **ask all questions provided to you and reveal all the relevant information**.
There is no correct order in which the questions should be asked, so don't worry about waiting for a cue.
If there is nothing under a character's name, it means you don't have any specific questions to ask or information to reveal.
You are, however, welcome to ask general questions like "where were you at the time of the murder" or try and suggest a motive.
You may also ask any questions that come to mind.

## In summary:
**During your own cross examination:** turn to the pages in your booklet giving information about your own cross examination, and respond accordingly.
**During the cross examination of others:** turn to the pages in your booklet giving information about the other characters, and respond accordingly. Be sure to reveal information and level accusations as indicated.

If asked to introduce yourself, you can read the bio given in the newspaper.
