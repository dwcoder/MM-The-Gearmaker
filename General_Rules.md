**You are welcome to keep these notes with you and consult them as needed. You don't have to learn the information by heart, but some preparation will make the evening more enjoyable. At the very least, read through the information once before arrival.**

Arrive in character, and try to stay in character for the remainder of the evening.
Below are your speaking notes and clues.
These include information about your character, as well as your relationship with other characters.
During the night, a murder will take place, after which each of the characters will be informally cross examined, taking turns.

After the cross-examinations, all the guests will sit down for a dinner during which they will try to figure out who the murderer is.

There is no set script, but during the cross examination some of the other characters will accuse you of things, or ask you questions. Characters are free to revisit questions and clarify statements after a cross-examination.
Act as you would if you are locked in a room with a killer; with respect, but suspicion.

You should give them the answers below, and you should respond accordingly.
You are not allowed to lie about any of the information below, and you _have_ to reveal the relevant information if prompted. You don't have to reveal information if you feel that you haven't been asked the relevant question.

If you are asked something completely irrelevant, you are free to improvise an answer, as long as it doesn't create new relationships and intrigue (outside of that provided below) between characters and thus confuse the story. If you don't want to improvise an answer to an irrelevant question, respond with "I don't see how that is relevant".

During the cross examinations of the other characters, you will have questions and accusations to throw at them. There is no correct order, but make sure you do **ask all questions provided to you and reveal all the relevant information**. If you don't have specific questions for a character, you are also welcome to ask general questions like "where were you at the time" or try and suggest a motive.

## In summary:
**During your own cross examination:**, turn to the pages in your booklet giving information about your own cross examination, and respond accordingly.
